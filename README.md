## Introduction

This is a
[Stripes](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core)
UI module: a console for administrating
[Okapi](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi).

It can be added to a Stripes instance by
[the usual procedure](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/building-from-git-checkouts.md#adding-more-modules)
and there is no corresponding server-side module to add, since the
Okapi Console communicates with
[Okapi's built-in web-services](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#okapis-own-web-services).

See [Running a complete FOLIO system](doc/running-a-complete-system.md)
for information on using the Okapi Console as part of a complete
system, and using it to start modules on the server.
